      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>I am currently diving deep into multiple personal projects, with a focus on expanding my knowledge and skills in areas like Kotlin Multiplatform, Compose, React, and, most importantly, leveraging AI for software development. </p>
      <p>These projects are not just side tasks; they represent my passion for exploring cutting-edge technologies and finding innovative ways to apply them. </p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve been particularly excited about how Kotlin Multiplatform simplifies cross-platform development and how AI is reshaping the way we approach problem-solving in software engineering.</p>
